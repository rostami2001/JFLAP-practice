# Formal languages and automata - JFLAP Projects (2023)

This repository contains my implementations of automata projects for the Theory of Languages and Automata course using JFLAP software.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Finite Automata
- **DFA/NFA Construction**: Designed both DFA and NFA machines for languages:
  - `L = {w ∈ {a, b}* | w ends with 'baab'}`
  - `L = {w ∈ {0, 1}* | w has odd number of 1's and at least two 0's}`
- **NFA to DFA Conversion**: Implemented and proved equivalence

### Project 2: Advanced Automata
- **Pushdown Automaton**: Implemented PDA for `L = {ba(ab)^na(ab)^n | n ≥ 0}`
- **Turing Machine**: Built a ternary (base-3) addition machine

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Regular language recognition
- NFA/DFA equivalence
- Context-free language processing
- Turing machine computation
- Formal language theory applications
